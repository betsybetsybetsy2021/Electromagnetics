Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics

This is my real undergraduate background.  Let it live again.  

By the way, I am a tea person now.  I already had my coffee. 

And I cannot do the homework because I am NOT in the home; Someone else is in the beds. You make me pay, and I don't have the money to pay to stay at that home. The money from earlier levels was spent living sparsely in confusion because no guidance was given.  I was told "go start a new life somewhere else" and "you will figure it out" but told DC was no good because too much time there already.

I have never been inside a real US courthouse except for a speeding ticket.  No crime other than property damage has been done in little america and I paid.  everyone else claiming harm by me is a liar.

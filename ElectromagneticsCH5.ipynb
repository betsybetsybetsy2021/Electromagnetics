    "Del, you'd rather farm Mark with no high school education than develop a non-christian woman in YOUR field?  Remember tarring that caravan roof with Mark in that trailer park.  Mark said, \"me or Del\" and you ignored me completely. I was the one with an EE degree, the one whose father studied in Shiraz.  Those people were NOT my family. Those were thieves.  I have NEVER been married to anyone, although a Muslim man named Sherif spending time with me temporary marriage to justify \"dating\" for himself under his religious beliefs. \n",
